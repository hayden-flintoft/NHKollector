        "overview": "Fukuoka facing the Genkai Sea has been geographically and historically a city open to East Asia. It still maintains links with many Asian countries-- from Port of Fukuoka, there is a ferry which runs between Fukuoka and Busan in the Republic of Korea.\r\nWalking through the city, our reporter Vincent encounters a wide variety of things which ties to East Asia. Yanagibashi Rengo Ichiba, a market which is known as Fukuoka's kitchen, offers foods and ingredients which trace their roots to different regions of Asia. Here, various food ingredients represent Asia -- Mentaiko came from the Korean Peninsula, steamed buns came from China and fishcakes (fried fish paste) came from Southeastern Asia. Foods which crossed the sea to Fukuoka were adapted to Japanese tastes and developed a new food culture.\r\nHow do local people feel about ties to East Asia? TOKO, a Fukuoka-based essayist introduces us to new movements in Fukuoka. One of the new attempts is to present new fashion to Asia from Fukuoka. Every year, local designers participate in a fashion show called \"Asian Collection\". Seiji Amamoto, a designer who participated in the show, aims to introduce his brand, a collaboration of Fukuoka's traditional silk textile \"Hakata-ori\" and denim, to the Chinese market.\r\nFukuoka has many foreign residents and there is a new attempt in the music field too. There is a group of Japanese and Chinese musicians who play their country's traditional folk instruments to create a new form of Asian music.\r\nAt last, TOKO takes Vincent to the best spot for feeling \"Asia\". It's the food stalls called \"Yatai\", which can be seen in many other Asian countries. Fukuoka has the largest number of stalls in Japan, about 160. Here, Vincent experiences oddly cozy space where strangers can open up easily.",

The recipe may have changed slightly over the years but the medicine is still used today.\r\nTraveling salesmen used to peddle this medicine all over the country. In an age when there was little medicine available, the cures these salesmen offered were very much appreciated. This was how Toyama's medicine spread to households nationwide. At its height, some 12,000 salesmen traveled over the mountains, selling medicine?\r\nThe City of Toyama is surrounded on three sides by rugged mountains, 3000 meters high. It used to be a very difficult place to get out of.\r\nToyama thrived with maritime trade, with people traveling over waters, and spreading their networks all over the country.\r\nThe company was founded in 1968 and did not follow the general trend of mass production. And so, it excelled in producing cars with rare and classical designs.\r\nThe design is based on the Japanese myth Orochi about a great snake with eight heads. He had incorporated the mythological beast into the car's design.\r\n\r\nThe people of Toyama have paved their way with their wisdom and spirit to offer hospitable services. Their strong will to overcome challenges still prevails.",

The purple lavender fields in summer turns into pure white snowfields in winter. Furano ski resorts offer quality powder snow which is perfect for skiing and attracts skiers from around the world. The winter season in Furano presents various options to enjoy the great outdoors. The most exciting of all is an adventure trip on a dog sled. Our reporter Sotaro Nagasawa visits Hidetaka Matsubara in Minami Furano. Matsubara owns 29 sled dogs which are hybrids of Siberian husky and wolf. These wolfdogs can withstand cold temperature and are good runners, which make them optimal companions for dog sledding.\r\nSotaro, with Matsubara as a guide, rides a dog sled and heads for snow-covered primeval forests which even locals rarely enter.\r\nOn their way, they stop by at Kanayama, a village developed by pioneers who came to seek gold a hundred years ago. They meet Sato's in the village who showed them gold gathered during the gold-rush and hear about the tales from those years.\r\nDuring Sotaro's three-day dog sledding trip, he sleds as he takes care of his six dogs. The most important point of dog sledding is a trusting relationship with dogs. Sotaro struggles as he goes sometimes left behind by dogs.\r\nIn the snow, they set up a tent by themselves and camp by utilizing nature's resources. On the last day, Sotaro changes his gear from dog sled to skis and aims for a habitat of brown bears. He finds animal foot prints in the snow and brown bear's claw marks on big trees.\r\nThis edition introduces you to an adventure which can be experienced only in deep snow of Hokkaido during winter.",

His destination is Naoshima of Kagawa Prefecture, a small island in the Seto Inland Sea, with a population of some 3300. Naoshima has gathered global attention as a center of contemporary art. Some 30,000 tourists now visit this island from Japan and abroad every year.\r\n\r\nThe Red Pumpkin created by Yayoi Kusama welcomes visitors at Naoshima's main port of Miyaura. The island showcases many pieces of contemporary art in harmony with the island's natural environment.\r\nThe first place Dario visits is the Honmura District in the eastern part of the island. Here, many old houses and a shrine have been transformed into pieces of art, to form the Art House Project.\r\nThe old meets contemporary art, coming alive again today with new value.\r\n\r\nA local volunteer guide Terunori Takahashi takes Dario to see interesting pieces of art around the island, and Dario learns about the relationship between the islanders and art.\r\n\r\nWith contemporary art so embedded in their lives now, some people of the island have even been inspired to create themselves. Akira Kojima who lives in the Honmura District has been making dolls with empty cans for five years now. Though it is a simple idea, it has become one of the signature pieces of Naoshima.\r\nThe Naoshima Slag Ceramic Art Experience Studio was also set up to offer people the chance to experience art for themselves on the \"island of contemporary art.\" Dario also tries his hand at pottery, following the instructions by the local women, as a wonderful souvenir of this trip.\r\n\r\nNaoshima is alive with contemporary art. The defining moment for the \"island of contemporary art\" was the opening of the Chichu Art Museum. As the name \"Chichu\" (literally meaning \"in the ground\") suggests, most of the building is submerged in the ground. It is indeed a unique museum, housing works by three masters of light, Claude Monet, Walter De Maria, and James Turrell. The piece",

He lives in Tokyo but he loves the natural environment around Oshino Village so much that he built a villa there seven years ago. He shows Adeyto some of the beautiful spots in the area, and introduces her to the local people.\r\nThe region around Oshino Village is famous for its high quality spring water. Hasegawa takes Adeyto to a beautiful spring where water from Mt. Fuji bubbles up. They also visit a local couple who have a natural spring on their property and use the water every day.\r\nThey also meet some amateur photographers whose hobby is taking photos of Mt. Fuji. They have many anecdotes to share about their efforts to capture the best shots of the mountain.\r\nOn the second day of their trip, they are shown some special decorations for two annual events. To mark the traditional Girls' Day festival, families put up displays of beautiful dolls, while banners with impressive decorations are put up for the Boys' Day.\r\nNext, Hasegawa takes Adeyto to meet a local musician. Tatsuro Omata is often called \"the musician of the woods\" because he transforms bamboo, branches and even nuts into musical instruments.

        "overview": "In this week's journeys in japan, we visit the Tottori Sand Dunes, the largest in Japan, in Tottori Prefecture.\r\nThe Tottori Sand Dunes skirt the Sea of Japan in the southwestern part of Japan. The dunes were created naturally over 100,000 years by sediments carried from the mountains down the river and eventually blown up onto the shore.\r\n\r\nOur reporter Vincent Giry wonders into the land of majestic dunes and meets people who live together with sand.\r\nFirst, he joins the member of the photography club at the Tottori School for the Deaf. Students who have hearing difficulties tend to have a fear of communicating with other people. The activity of taking photographs of the visitors to the dunes, a major tourist spot, began as a way for students to overcome their sense of fear. This club activity encourages students to proactively talk to people who they meet for the first time. Vincent will find out how this activity made a difference on the students.\r\nAfter enjoying a photo session at the dunes with the students, Vincent sets out to see how \"suna-tamago\", the sand eggs are made. Here, he has a chance to observe \"wisdom for living\" based on local traditions. In fact, the secret to the creation of sand eggs was this wisdom itself. How did wisdom inspired making of the eggs?\r\n\r\nDuring his trip, Vincent also has a chance to learn about art made of sand, a crop which thrives only in the severe conditions of the dunes, and the research on dunes that is beneficial in arid lands around the world. By coming into contact with cultures old and new, we can see a coexistent relationship between the people and the sand which derived from unique geographical features of the sand dunes and the wisdom and the resourceful ideas that still exist today to benefit the local people in their lives.",

Nakajima began releasing egg carrying female crabs to the sea some 25 years ago and people in the town are now working together for the preservation of crab stock.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, when Japan still had an isolation policy, a delegate from Imperial Russia sailed to Japan to negotiate a commercial treaty between the two countries. But the crew was stranded when an earthquake-triggered tsunami destroyed the Russian vessel. Heda's shipbuilders helped the Russians construct a new vessel, the first Western-style ship to be built in Japan.\r\nThe people of Heda are proud of their history of helping the Russians and spreading shipbuilding technology around Japan.\r\n\r\nHeda also produces some of the finest salt, using minneral-and-nutrient rich seawater from Suruga Bay. To make the salt, the seawater is boiled down for 13 hours. Careful attention is given to many factors including the timing of scooping the crystallized salt, firing it in the furnace and letting it mature. The Heda salt is full of rich natural flavor.\r\n\r\nOse Shrine has a history of eleven centuries with fishermen from the entire Suruga Bay worshipping the enshrined guardian god of the sea.\r\nThe Ose Matsuri is an ancient festival of fishermen where men dressed as women dance on boats, colorfully decorated with vivid banners and various blossoms. Today, the spectacular festival which takes place on April 4th every year is the most famous event in the region with non-fishermen residents also participating. Accord",

However, in April work began on a major restoration program. This magnificent landmark will gradually be covered in scaffolding from the bottom upwards; by the autumn of 2010, the main keep will be completely hidden from view.\r\n\r\nThe people of Himeji are concerned that this will mean that fewer tourists come to visit their city. So they have been coming up with ideas to ensure that Himeji remains a major draw for visitors. Our reporter, George Burdaniotis, visited the city to find out what is going on.\r\n\r\nHe met a group that discusses ways to promote the city. One of the participants, local photographer Kazuya Haga, takes George to visit his favorite viewpoints of the castle.\r\n\r\nGeorge also meets some of the craftsmen whose families have been working in Himeji for many generations. He visits a company that makes the tiles that adorn Himeji Castle, and also a traditional metalworker that began making armor for the samurai warriors 800 years ago, but which now produces wind chimes.\r\n\r\nFinally, George falls in with a band of 'samurai' in full armor. These warriors are volunteers who gather every Sunday to chat to visitors and pose for photos, giving tourists a sense of the long history of this historic castle town.\r\n\r\nThe start of renovation work on Himeji Castle has led to various initiatives to promote the city. Although the landmark will not be visible for the next five years, the local people will still be welcoming visitors with all their heart.",

For long years, it flourished as a castle town and was a home to many samurai. Our reporter JJ explores its samurai legacy.\r\n\r\nJJ first visits Uesugi Shrine, dedicated to the great lord Uesugi Kenshin who was in power about 500 years ago. Yonezawa was long ruled by generations of Kenshin's descendants. In 1871, local followers of the Uesugi clan built Uesugi Shrine in honor of Kenshin on the former site of Yonezawa Castle. At the shrine, JJ meets samurai enthusiasts who show him the appeal of samurai. In fact, Yonezawa is home to a big festival called the Uesugi Matsuri every May. Some 700 samurai enthusiasts from across Japan don costumes and participate in the mock battle to get a sense of what is was like to be a warrior 500 years ago. JJ wears the armor of a 16th century warlord.\r\n\r\nIn Yonezawa, there are lots of hedges with the ukogi plant. Many ukogi hedges were created during the 18th century as part of a clan policy. The lord of Yonezawa domain at the time was Uesugi Yozan, the tenth family head of the Uesugi caln. Yozan conceived the idea to utilize ukogi as an emergency food source. During his reign, Yonezawa's food supply was very tight. So Yozan encouraged people to cook and eat ukogi plant with staples. JJ meets local people who are carrying on the tradition of ukogi dining. JJ caps off his visit by dipping at a hot spring in Yonezawa frequented by generations of the Uesugi clan.\r\nJJ feels the warrior's legacy in Yonezawa.",

These pickled fruit are really sour and salty but they go perfectly with rice.\r\n\r\nJJ visits a Zen temple that has a special connection with this ume-growing region.\r\nSoten Akamatsu, the priest at this temple, has kept a jar of umeboshi made over 150 years ago by a doctor of traditional oriental medicine. In the old days, this was considered a very effective medicine.\r\n\r\nThanks to the thick, lush forests covering the local hills, Minabe is also famous for its premium bincho-tan charcoal. Compared to regular charcoal, binchotan burns for longer and maintains a constant heat during the cooking process. It also cooks foods faster, and draws out their flavors to the maximum.\r\n\r\nWhen JJ is introduced to veteran charcoal-burners, Yukio Hara and his son Masaaki, they cook fish over charcoal for him.\r\nThe forestry tradition that's been passed down since ancient times remains very much alive here to this day.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his trip, JJ meets another ume farmer, Masahiko Gekko, who produces sweet and fruity umeshu, liquor made with ume fruit.\r\nHe wants more people to discover the rich flavor of this drink, which he prepares from the Nanko-ume fruit that he harvests with such care from his orchards.",

Japanese candles have big flames and less soot, and the warm glow has brightened the lives of Japanese people for a long time. Omori coats the wick, made from Japanese washi paper and silk, with melted vegetable wax using his bare hands, a traditional method. His son, Ryotaro has also started candle making and the two generations continue the age old tradition together.\r\nNext, a trip out of town takes you to peaceful countryside. Visitors can experience country life and cooking at a traditional inn run by local housewives. The inn provides popular accomodation for about one thousand guests every year. Peter experienced mountain herb picking, tasted country cooking and spent a lovely time in the mountain valley.\r\n\r\nMany people are charmed by Uchiko's beautiful scenery.

So what is it like?\r\nLaura Adeyto goes to visit the house of Takeshi Machida, whom she met in Tochigi City, to spend a day of rural life.\r\nGoing out to weed the rice fields and chopping wood to feed the fire to cook rice, it is all about taking the time and effort. It is indeed a \"slow life\" experience.\r\n\r\nPeople who normally enjoy the convenience of urban life rarely feel the presence of nature close at hand these days.\r\nA way of life in nature seemed to emanate a nostalgic feel, something we seem to have forgotten and left behind.",

People here have long enjoyed marine sports. A legendary French diver had strong ties with the sea of Karatsu. Jacques Mayol was the first man in the world to free dive to 100 meters. And it was a childhood encounter with a dolphin off the coast of Karatsu that inspired him to dive. Our reporter Ian Thomas Ash investigates the diver's deep connection to Karatsu.\r\n\r\nIan visits the Nanatsu-caves, where Mayol met his first dolphin. Local diver, Atsushi Takashima, who accompanied Mayol whenever he dived in Karatsu, points out the things that Mayol loved about the area. Mayol also enjoyed the company of the people of Karatsu. He always stayed in the same traditional Japanese inn when visiting. He loved its simple natural aesthetic, and the garden view through the seasons. The inn has long been popular with visitors from overseas. Inn owner, Akihiko Okochi gives Ian a tour of the inn. It's easy to see why people would fall in love with it.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, Karatsu enjoyed prosperity through its thriving trade with Asian countries. The two Chinese characters of its name reflect this history, Kara is an old word for China and Tsu for port. Ian meets a local fish cake maker, Kazunori Fujikawa. They visit the fish market where Fujikawa points out local specialties.\r\n\r\nIn autumn, the city residents look forward to a major festival called the Karatsu Kunchi, which celebrates abundant harvests. It features a spectacular parade of giant floats. Inn owner Okochi takes Ian to a museum where people can get a close up look at the floats. Ian learns what the festival means to the people of Karatsu.",

Thus many rivers flow through Hita City and are serving the local people in their daily lives.\r\n\r\nThe Mikuma River crosses the center of the town east to west. The traveler in our program visits Yana or traditional Japanese fish trap site at the river. This is a fishing method existing from ancient times. Anglers wait for ayu sweetfish coming down the river to lay eggs. When ayu gets on the trap made by weaving bamboo, they catch the fish by hand. The sweetfish is salted and grilled on a skewer, and eaten.\r\n\r\nThe traveler also visits a Geta-clog factory situated along the river. Hita is a major cedar growing area in Japan. Making Geta-clogs using cedar wood has been done on a large scale from the Edo Period.\r\nIn addition to traditional \"Hita Geta\" making use of the wood's grain pattern, we get to see many new-style Geta-clogs that go well with not only traditional Japanese kimonos but also western-style dresses. The new designs are made to match recent fashion and tastes of young women.\r\n\r\nDuring the Edo Period, Hita City prospered under the direct control of the shogunate government. A district in the city called Mameda Town retains street sceneries from the old days. The traveler goes around the district riding on a rickshaw. He meets with a unique sweets vendor, and visits a local brewer making sake using good-quality underground water.\r\nAt Onta village where pottery making has been done for 300 years, the traveler encounters a device called \"Kara-usu\" used for grinding clay used for pottery making.

He asked his cooks in Japan to recreate it.\r\nTogo's staff used sugar and soy sauce as seasoning. Nikujaga entered Japan's culinary culture as food for naval officers.\r\n\r\n\"Thin udon noodle.\"\r\nKure adapted a Japanese dish in its own way, too. Local chefs toyed with the udon noodle.  But what's served in Kure is a little unorthodox. Kure's udon noodles are cut much thinner.\r\n\r\nThis style of udon spread in Kure in the early Showa Period.The founder of this shop ran a small stall, peddling thin noodles around town. His customers at the time were busy shipyard workers. He wanted to prepare delicious fare for workers who had little time to spare. This was the main reason behind cutting thin udon-for quick preparation and consumption.\r\n\r\n\"Nikutama Rice provides stamina.\"\r\nKure has still has many industrial senior high schools and mercantile marine schools. Young students learn welding and other skills. They eventually take up careers that support Kure's industry. Students head to a popular place every morning. They love its nikutama rice. It's a simple dish.  Thinly sliced pork is grilled.  Steamed rice is served in a bowl. The rice is flavored with a mixture of condiments. Then a lightly fried egg and the pork slices are placed on top. The rice bowl is laced with a generous amount of okonomiyaki sauce. It's topped off with a dollop of mayonnaise-voila Nikutama",

The hot springs in the Hachimantai area have been popular with the local people for centuries.\r\nPeople come to Tamagawa Onsen just to breathe in all the steam that gushes out of the holes in the rock. It's known as 'steam bathing' and it's very therapeutic. Another way to benefit from the heat is just to feel it soaking up into your body. The temperature of the ground varies from 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. Just lying down on it is enough to heat up your body. People put down their straw mats wherever they choose.\r\nThe practice of toji is deeply rooted in Japanese life. There are still many hot spring inns catering to toji in northern Japan. They are especially popular in rural communities, and are used by farming families once the crops have been harvested. At inns like this, people meet and get to know each other. Staying as a toji is therapeutic - not just for the body but also the mind and spirit.",

In the old days, these kazura bridges used to be the only way to get across the river. One of the bridges is 45 meters long. Because they do not last long, the local villagers remake the kazura bridges every three years.\r\n\r\nIya Village is no longer so cut off, and there have been many changes in recent years. Many of the traditional farmhouses with their thatched roofs have been lost. But one old house was saved from destruction after being bought by an American man, Alex Kerr, who discovered the Iya Valley in the 1970s. Now the 300-year-old building is run by an NPO, the Chiiori Trust, which works alongside local residents to help preserve the traditional architecture.\r\n\r\nAdeyto visits a community built on the steep mountainside, to find out about the traditional lifestyle in this remote settlement. The buckwheat harvest is just over and she gets to try a traditional dish made from buckwheat grain.\r\n\r\nFinally, Adeyto hikes to the top of Mt. Tsurugi, the second highest peak in Shikoku, located at the far end of the Iya Valley. The mountain takes its name from a sword that was hidden here some 800 years ago, which belonged to a young emperor who died in battle. For the local people, this is a sacred spot.

        "overview": "This week on \"journeys in japan\" we visit Koyasan in Wakayama prefecture. It's an ancient Buddhist sanctuary, far removed from the secular world. More than 1000 priests reside in the mountain hamlet, engaged in daily ascetic practices. There are 117 temples in Koyasan, but the whole complex is regarded as one big temple for Shingon Esoteric Buddhism.\r\n\r\nKoyasan was registered as a World Cultural Heritage site in 2004. It draws more than 1-million tourists every year. Temple stays, called shukubo, are proving popular with visitors from overseas. They take in the tranquil life of monks through involvement in ascetic practices-a rarefied experience not normally a part of tourism. Our reporter JJ has been in Japan for 10 years, but this will be his first time to stay at a temple. He is looking forward to partaking in its various rituals.\r\n\r\nJJ has booked a room at Ekoin, a temple that is very popular among visitors from abroad, who account for nearly half of its overnight guests. Resident-monk Chokei Tamura, who lived in the UK, looks after him. He explains the shukubo or daily schedule for the temple.\r\n\r\nA strictly followed timetable is observed at Ekoin during guests' stay. The first program is the 4:30 p.m. meditation session. Then, from 5:30, guests delight in Buddhist vegetarian cuisine, called shojin-ryori. After supper, they try their hand at transcribing Buddhist sutra. Then at dawn, they'll rise to take part in a service starting at 6:30 a.m. From 7:00, they attend a bonfire ritual called the Goma. JJ, like others, is on a spiritual journey to experience the Koyasan way of life, and perhaps even encounter a few things to incorporate in life at home.",

        "overview": "On \"journeys in japan,\" our reporter Julian ventures to Ishinomaki City in Miyagi Prefecture, about 400 kilometers north of Tokyo.\r\n\r\nIshinomaki prospered as a fishery town, but recently has become known for promoting Japanese comics. Manga City-Ishinomaki was developed in homage to local manga legend, Shotaro Ishinomori (1938-1998), through the joint efforts of fans and fellow artists. Ishinomori had long dreamed of creating a town where people were exposed to manga on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nOn weekends and holidays, the colorful \"Mangattan Liner,\" which is decorated with famous characters from Ishinomori's work, runs between Sendai and Ishinomaki. Employees, dressed as famous hero characters, greet passengers getting off at Ishinomaki station. Life-size manga figures are also displayed in the station-the gateway to Mangaland-and other characters appear on the façade, as well as stained glass windows.\r\n\r\n\"Manga Road\" is lined with 20 full-scale manga characters. Manhole covers, benches and even letterboxes feature manga motifs.\r\n\r\nThe nearly one-kilometer-long \"Manga Road\" ends at a large river. Its sandbar has been nicknamed \"Mangattan\" by local residents. The Ishinomaki Mangattan Museum is located here. It houses Ishinomori manga, anime and original artwork. There are game and library areas. The museum promotes the understanding of manga culture and history.\r\n\r\nNot far from Ishinomaki port is Tashiro-jima Island. Ishinomori adored this island for its low-key atmosphere and gorgeous scenery. At one point, he had planned to relocate his family and entire studio and staff to the island. Now, \"Manga Lodges\" have been built on the island. Each of the cat-shaped cottages has been painted by leading manga artists, featuring their famous characters.\r\n\r\nThe people of Ishinomaki and Tashiro-jima, in conjunction with leading manga artists, have collaborated to fulfill Shintaro Ishinomori's dreams.\r\n",

Known as the minpaku system, visitors can stay at the homes of local families for a fee of about 6,000 yen per night. It's a chance for visitors to spend time with the host families, eating dinner with them and experiencing the way they live. For an extra charge (2,000 yen), guests can also get hands-on experience of the local people's work, such as fishing and farming.\r\n\r\nChurches\r\nAlong the coast of Fukuejima, there are 14 Catholic churches. Such a concentration is unusual anywhere in Japan, and dates from the time when Christians found refuge from persecution on the island during the feudal period. Various churches are introduced, including the white Mizunoura Church; the stately brick Douai Church; and Kaizu Church, with its beautiful stained glass windows. Visitors are free to look around the churches during regular opening hours.\r\n\r\nCamellia oil head spa\r\nCamellia trees can be found growing all over the island and their oil is one of the specialties of Fukuejima. A salon called Monte Cange offers a head and facial massages using the camellia seed oil. It is located inside the Shirayuri beauty salon, in the main shopping area of Fukue.\r\n\r\nBebencobicci Orchestra\r\nYoung musicians on Fukuejima have formed a band, singing songs about their local area, using their own distinct dialect.

Thanks to their long experience and remarkable precision, the highly skilled craftsmen can produce these items by hand, to specifications accurate to the nearest 1/100th of a millimeter.\r\n\r\nAdeyto's second stop is at a foundry in Saitama, just to the north of Tokyo, where craftsmen handle molten steel at temperatures up to 1,510 degrees. Visitors can try their hand at casting small metal objects, such as personalized bottle openers.\r\n\r\nNext she visits a factory that makes shots used by Olympic champions and shot-putters all around the world. 77-year-old Masahisa Tsujitani's shots are in demand because he can produce them with a center of gravity precisely in the very center. His craftsmanship is so precise he can make them without even looking at his lathe.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last workshop that Adeyto visits makes high-precision components for aircraft seats. As a sideline, the company also makes a range of exclusive products that are prized by top international celebrities.

This kind of topography, known as a ria coastline, is perfect for oyster cultivation.\r\nKokichi Mikimoto is the person who first successfully cultured pearl. In 1888 when he was 40, he first started his research. He experimented with nearly 10 types of oysters, to determine which would form the highest quality pearls. In 1893, after 5 years of experimenting, he finally managed to produce his first cultured pearl.\r\nThe place we visited was a small island called Pearl Island, there is a museum where visitors can find out about the history of cultured pearls.\r\nThere are many women divers in Toba who catch shellfish and lobsters. There is the hat where visitors can come to feast on freshly caught seafood by women divers. Everyone can enjoy great seafood and view from this hut.\r\nIn Toba, pearls are even incorporated in food.\r\nPearl powder is rich in calcium and has been used as a traditional medicine in China since ancient times.\r\nWe visited the ice cream shop serving the ice cream with pearl powder in.\r\nAt the end, we visited the place where we can see the artworks using pearls.\r\nToshimi Konishi has been using pearls to make distinctive artworks for 40 years. Konishi says he came up with the idea of making these artworks when he was thinking up ways to use the pearls that have irregular shapes and can't be sold.\r\nAlso a 20 minutes ferry journey from Toba port brings you to Dolphin Island.

Since ancient times, there have been numerous legends about gods and strange beings that have been passed down in this region.\r\n\r\nLake Shinji is one of the symbols of Matsue and a source of pride for the local people. It was also an inspiration for a writer from Europe who lived in this tranquil city many decades ago. Lafcadio Hearn came to Matsue 120 years ago to work as an English teacher. He met his wife here and adopted the Japanese name, Koizumi Yagumo.\r\n\r\nOn this edition of Journeys in Japan, Haruka Orth explores this traditional city. She gets dressed up in a gorgeous kimono. Then she takes a ride on a sightseeing boat on the moat by the ancient castle. And she visits a shrine that's believed to help people find love and marriage. Haruka also meets two people who have been deeply influenced by Lafcadio Hearn.\r\n\r\nTraveler: Haruka Orth",

Jutting out significantly into the Pacific Ocean, Cape Muroto enjoys a mild climate throughout the year, thanks to the warm Kuroshio Current flowing near the shore.  Hawaiian-born Michael Rivas visited Cape Muroto in early March to get the feel of early spring.\r\n\r\nAt first, Michael stops at the rocky area covering the very end of the cape. This area is part the Muroto Anan Kaigan Quasi-National Park which was registered in 1964. Varied configurations of the earth's surfaces and unusually-shaped rocks sticking out from the ground were raised from the seabed over a period of 100 billion years by the dynamic tectonic activity. Michael asks landscape photographer Hakushi Maeda to introduce him the charms of Cape Muroto's local nature.\r\n\r\nThe most active industry on and around Cape Muroto is fishery. The Kuroshio Current flowing off the cape brings a lot of blessings of the sea. Muroto has a wide variety of fish dishes. Among them, Michael finds dried moray eel especially interesting.  In fact, the local people have a dietary tradition to eat the grotesque-looking fish also called \"the gang of the sea,\"\r\n\r\nThe area along the coast is a habitat of one of Japan's wild plants called \"hamaazami.\" Michael goes out to the beach to collect hamaazami together with Ms. Nakagawa whom he meets in the Takaoka District. Later, he has a chance to try home-made cuisines using wild hamaazami to enjoy one of the best tastes of spring at Cape Muroto.\r\n\r\nFinally, Michael reaches Kiragawa Town, which is characterized by beautiful ancient storages finished with plasters. Kiragawa Town was once thrived with a trade of bincho-tan charcoal. The ancient section of the town was designated as one of the country's traditional architectures preservation district in 1997. It holds a grand doll festival on the 3rd of March every year, in which visitors are fre",

The popular tourist destination is about three hours from Tokyo. First, JJ tries his hand at fly-fishing on the Kawazu River. He's after amago, which is in season. His next stop is a wasabi farm. Grated wasabi is typically served with sashimi and other dishes. But JJ gets to experience new ways of eating grated wasabi, as well as its leaves. He then moves on to a bamboo forest, where he looks for takenoko bamboo shoots just poking out of the ground. Bamboo shoots, with their distinctive texture and slightly sweet flavor, are considered a seasonal delicacy and make their way into a variety of dishes. Nature and food lovers will enjoy this show!\r\n\r\nKawazu River access:\r\nFrom Kawazu Station on the Izu Kyuko line, it's a short walk to the river. Purchase a day-permit for 1,000 yen-proceeds go to conserving fish habitats. For more information on prime fishing points and places where permits can be purchased-indicated by fish-shaped icons-visit the website below.\r\n\r\nAmago season: from March 1 to October 31.\r\nAyu (sweet fish) season: from first week of June to December 31.\r\n\r\nA word on amago dining:\r\nWhile there are over 50 places to stay near the Kawazu River, none serves amago on a regular basis.  JJ stayed at an inn that serves amago seasonally-and only when the owner is able to catch the fish!\r\n\r\nWasabi farm access:\r\nFrom Kawazu Station, head toward the mountains on National Route 414 where you will find several shops selling hon-wasabi (fresh wasabi), as well as wasabi leaves chopped and mixed with sake lees. Fresh wasabi is nothing like what is sold in tubes or powder form (which may contain no hon-wasabi at all!). Hon-wasabi is both pungent and sweet.\r\n\r\nBamboo shoot digging:\r\nThe season for takenoko bamboo shoots is generally from April to mid-May.\r\nIn the fall, shihochiku bamboo, a slender shoot can be harvest",

Measuring two kilometers in length and two meters in width, the shopping street is comprised of two narrow stretches each going to the opposite directions. The one in the east is \"Sannomiya Kokashita Shopping Street\", which is lined by a wide variety of restaurants and shops, including those dealing with trendy fashion, used clothes, and accessories. The other is \"Motomachi Kokashita Shopping Street\" that stretches to the west and is usually dubbed as \"Motokoh.\"\r\n\r\nOriginated in a black market from the postwar era, the shopping street thrived dynamically in the 1960s with many dock workers and sailors of foreign ships. In the present days, the shopping district grows increasingly distinctive as it goes toward the west. The west half attracts middle-aged and old shoppers as well, thanks to a number of shops that sell antiquities, vintage electric appliances, and used clothes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the number of vacant shops is on an increase here because of the trend of time. But people from the kokashita shopping street are willing to organize new events to help cheer up the whole of Kobe with the power of art.\r\n\r\nThe shopping street is free of any formalities. You can feel easy to go out in your everyday clothes and associate with local shop owners and customers. Among many unusual places is a restaurant which is always crowded with regular customers who repeat coming back almost every day. There are also shops where you can expect to find one of the rarest items. One of other shops may give you a chance to recall part of the memory from your prime time, with its merchandise.\r\n\r\nNHK World reporter George Bourdaniotis walks through the shopping street under Kobe's elevated railway track to bring you a lot of information.",

Commonly known as Kompira-san, this shrine was thought to bring good luck, offer protection for sailors and assure abundant harvests.\r\nOn this edition of Journeys in Japan, Haruka Orth explores the area around Kotohira Shrine, which seems to have changed very little since the days of old.\r\nAccording to ancient records, the shrine was established a thousand years ago. Originally, the deity here was worshipped for safety at sea. But from the 17th century, it started to attract many pilgrims from across Japan. Even today, 3 million people a year visit Kompira-san.\r\nThe shrine itself lies halfway up an outcropping known as Mount Zozu, at an altitude of 521 meters.\r\nThere are many smaller religious sites on the route before reaching the main shrine. Pilgrims believe their prayers will be answered just by climbing to the top.\r\nThis pilgrimage became very popular about 300 years ago. In those days it took about a month to get there from Edo - as Tokyo used to be called. Traveling by foot and boat, this was a once-in-a-lifetime trip for most visitors.\r\nHaruka sets off by train again to visit a nearby town that has its own traditional specialty. This area is Japan's top producer of bonsai pine trees. They have been grown here for almost two centuries.\r\nThe bonsai trees are planted in shallow trays. Over the centuries, intricate techniques were developed in Japan to produce these beautiful examples of nature in miniature. Gardeners carefully prune and train the branches, to create exactly the shape of tree they want.\r\nQuietly spending time tending bonsai trees - this has been a traditional pastime in Japan since the days of old.\r\n\r\nTraveler: Haruka Orth",

That samurai spirit still lives on in modern-day Kagoshima.\r\n\r\nKagoshima lies at the southern tip of Kyushu. It has a mild climate year-round, with warmer average temperatures than most other parts of Japan. It's a volcanic area, with many active volcanoes and abundant hot springs. The city of Kagoshima has been nicknamed the \"Naples of the East\" because both cities have bayside locations and have active volcanoes close-by. In fact, Kagoshima City and Naples actually have a sister-city tie-up.",

Prepared in the form of ink sticks, sumi has to be diluted in water to create a black liquid.\r\nUntil about 100 years ago, sumi was one of the most popular items sold at stationery stores. Today, ink sticks are rarely used in everyday life, but they are an essential aspect of traditional calligraphy. Shodo, the art of writing kanji characters with sumi ink, remains very popular.\r\n\r\nOn this edition of Journeys in Japan, John Gathright travels to Suzuka, in Mie Prefecture, where sumi has been produced for centuries. He meets a traditional ink-stick master craftsman and discovers the vibrant art of calligraphy.",

About 5,000 years ago, a prehistoric culture known as the Jomon flourished around the lower slopes. Remnants of the Jomon have been discovered at more than 300 sites in the area.\r\nOur reporter Peter MacMillan meets residents of mountainous communities, discovers their way of life, and traces the footsteps of the Jomon people hidden behind it. At museums adjacent to excavation sites, he marvels at the artistic quality of objects created by the Jomon people, such as clay figurines and earthenware vessels. He also treks through the Kirigamine plateau to reach its highest point-Kurumayama (1625m), enjoying the beautiful natural scenery on the way. Researchers believe the Jomon people visited the plateau frequently.",

From around 800 years ago, it was the capital of the samurai generals who ruled Japan.\r\n\r\nDuring that period, Zen Buddhism was introduced to Japan by priests from China. The philosophy and meditation practices of Zen were embraced by the samurai warriors, and many temples were built among the hills of Kamakura. This gave rise to the distinctive culture that can still be found in the city to this day.\r\n\r\nJust a few steps away from Kamakura's main street, you find yourself in narrow alleys where you can still feel traces of the city's past. Because of its long history and culture, Kamakura has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\r\n\r\nOn this edition of Journeys in Japan, Rosa Yum explores Kamakura when the autumn foliage is at its most beautiful, and visits several of the ancient religious sites in the city. She is shown how to practice Zen meditation and is introduced to shojin-ryori, the vegetarian cuisine served in the temples. She also observes kyudo, a spiritual practice based on the same kind of bows and arrows that were used by the samurai warriors.",

One of the highlights are a dance performance re-enacting a historical episode that took place 800 years ago. The shogun, Yoritomo, had fallen out with his younger brother, Yoshitsune, who fled the city on pain of death, leaving behind his lover, a court dancer called Shizuka-gozen. Forced to perform for the shogun, she expressed through her dance her undying love for Yoshitsune. To this day, local dancers recreate this tragic episode from Kamakura's early history. Another cultural tradition with a long history in Kamakura is the local style of lacquerware. Known as Kamakura-bori, it dates back to the days of the master craftsmen who carved the statues and altar surrounds in the Buddhist temples in the city's golden age. On this edition of Journeys in Japan, Rosa Yum returns to Kamakura to explore the city further. She meets a young dancer who will perform the famous dance, Shizuka no Mai.

The local people developed a deep understanding to survival in this challenging environment. They also created a distinctive culture that has been kept alive to the present day.\r\n\r\nSome of the gassho-zukuri houses are now used as guesthouses, where visitors can stay and observe the traditional customs. The style of dancing and music known as Kokiriko Bushi has been handed down for around 1,400 years. Originally a form of prayer for bountiful harvests, it is thought to be the oldest style of performing art in Japan.\r\n\r\nThis region faces a serious problem of depopulation.

In the Iwami region of Shimane Prefecture, Kagura has developed independently of other styles. Contemporary dancer, Alessandra Lupi visits a small village to explore the many dimensions of this magical performing art. Everything she encounters in the village is completely new to her. She stays in the home of a local couple and experiences preparing a local dish. At a kagura rehearsal, she sees a scene from the popular play, Orochi, and is captivated. Orochi is based on the myth of a giant evil serpent with 8 heads. A god finds a way to calm the serpent with sake and slays it. Through her interactions with the performers, who are passing on the tradition to the next generation, she contemplates the meaning of dance. And so she asks to join a local kagura group to dance in the role of Orochi in an autumn festival. Alessandra searches for the connection between kagura and the local way of life.\r\n",

The slopes where they grow, in the basin of the Yoneshiro River, are considered as one of the 3 most beautiful forests in all Japan. The term \"Akita Cedar\" can only be used for the trees that have grown naturally in this area and are over 150 years old. Because of the harsh winter climate, these cedars develop slowly, and their timber has a beautiful grain and strength that is not found in cedars from other parts of Japan. The heartland of Akita cedars spans the area from Odate to Noshiro, in the prefecture. In this area, people have developed a culture that draws strongly on this timber, and have a deep appreciation for their natural environment.\r\n\r\nJohn Kaizan Neptune is an American musician who plays the shakuhachi, a traditional Japanese musical instrument made of bamboo. John makes his own shakuhachi, using bamboo that he cuts himself. This is part of his philosophy of \"coexistence with nature\". On this episode of Journeys in Japan, John visits this area to explore the cedar forests, and meet the people whose lives and culture owe so much to the prosperity brought about by the Akita cedars.\r\n\r\nWalking Tour of Akita Cedars in the Wild\r\nVisitors can join a tour to explore the forests of Akita Cedar, which are now quite scarce. Participants are taken to see the tallest Akita cedar tree, which is an estimated 280 years old and is so high that its top cannot be seen from ground level. In this place, it is hard not to feel the greatness of nature.\r\n\r\nKimimachi Kankou Guide no Kai (Futatsui-machi Kankou Kyokai)\r\nAddress: 109-10 Nakajima Kotsunagi-aza, Futatsui-machi, Noshiro City, Akita Pref.",

Farmers were encouraged to forge nails as a sideline to their agriculture, to help them survive in lean years. Sanjo became an important production center for wakugi, the Japanese nails used in building shrines, temples and other wooden structures. That tradition continues to this day, with one local artisan producing nails for the periodic rebuilding of the Grand Shrine of Ise, in Mie Prefecture.\r\n\r\nEric Chevallier works as an apprentice blacksmith in Sakai, Osaka. He first came to Japan from France 3 years ago to learn the metalworking skills and craftsmanship of local blacksmiths. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, he observes an artisan creating traditional nails with pride and expertise. At another workshop, he observes close-up the processes for forging blades, where the owner and his son are keeping alive the time-honored techniques. Niigata gets some of the heaviest snowfalls in all of Japan. Eric also enjoys some of the customs observed by people in this area during the coldest season.",

Now practiced as a sport around the world, karate originated as a martial art that was practiced in secret, with esoteric teachings passed down from one generation to the next by the Ryukyu nobility and warriors.\r\n\r\nOn this episode of Journeys in Japan, aikido master William Reed travels to Okinawa to discover the essence of karate in its homeland. He visits practice halls (dojos) and meets with the top masters of various karate styles. He observes their training methods and is taught some of the fundamentals karate moves. In addition, he witnesses a dance that conceals within its movements the essence of the traditional Ryukyu martial art.

        "overview": "The Tomioka Silk Mill was the first modern factory ever built in Japan. Completed in 1872, it marked a major step for the country in its transformation from a traditional society to a high-tech industrialized nation. The mill was built by Japanese under the guidance of a young French engineer called Paul Brunat. He chose the location in Tomioka, at the foot of Mt. Myogi, because there was a long tradition of skilled artisan silk production and he found the local people took great care of their silkworms. The architecture of the mill combines both Japanese and western elements. It was equipped with technology that was state-of-the-art at that time, but also incorporated local knowhow that Brunat learned from the local farmers. Because the mill has been preserved so well, almost in the same condition as when it was built, it (together with related sites) was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June this year.\r\n\r\nOn this episode of Journeys in Japan, the Tomioka Silk Mill is introduced by Damien Robuchon who works for the Tomioka City Government. Like Paul Brunat, Damien comes from France. He was hired last year to help promote the mill's cultural significance, and to study documents relating to the time when Brunat was in Japan. Damien visits various sites and meets with people related to the local silk industry. He also explores the role that Paul Brunat played in building the mill and contributing to Japan's modernization.",

After sampling the atmosphere and street foods of Shinsekai, a long-established entertainment district, he goes in search of live music at the city's blues clubs. Some 90 years ago, Osaka was booming, and people came from all over Japan, and from other countries, looking for work.

He also goes to the Ikuno Korea Town, which has been the cradle for many musicians. Exploring the vibrant streets, the food, the local culture of humor, Charles starts to understand why the people of Osaka have such an affinity to the blues - and why the city has such an enduring charm.",

The truly unique atmosphere was a result of local people's long consistent efforts to conserve the old townscape. The traveler for this edition of Journeys in Japan joins a sightseeing tour around the city that is operated by the Otaru residents. She also experiences how to make a piece of glasswork, enjoys fresh food from the sea, and learns about the history and culture of Otaru.\r\n\r\nThe traveler visits a local port to take a look at herring fishing that is in season between January and March. The population of herrings was once down drastically due to overfishing – so much so that local fishermen were unable to catch the fish at all for decades. The size of its population has been on a gradual but steady increase, thanks to a variety of efforts including artificial breeding and releasing of herring fries. She also enjoys the taste of fresh herring in the top season, and listens to the stories of local fishermen who live very close to the sea and who engage in recovering the sea that is abundant with marine life. The program is full of information on the depth and charm of Otaru City. As it is located fairly close to Sapporo, the prefectural capital of Hokkaido, Otaru has been ranked among the most popular destinations among overseas tourists who are in Sapporo for tourism.",

Even today, the city has many areas of historical interest, with numerous temples and traditional merchant houses that have survived.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery year in early summer, a very distinctive event is held in Morioka. Called the Chagu Chagu Umako festival, it originated as an expression of appreciation for the hard work done by farm horses. As many as 100 horses take part in a parade through the streets, adorned with colorful costumes and numerous jingling bells.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe close relationship between farmers and their horses led to the development of traditional farmhouses known as Nanbu magariya. These houses have two wings, one for the people and the other for the horses, so they can all live under the same roof.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this edition of Journeys in Japan, Dean Newcombe visits a farmhouse where the horse is treated almost like a member of the family. He discovers the distinctive culture that has grown up from this close connection with horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nDean also samples the local specialties. He visits three restaurants to try the three different styles of noodles: wanko soba; Morioka reimen; and Morioka jajamen. He also finds out how these popular dishes that have such different cultural backgrounds became famous as local specialties.\r\n",

And the Horizontal Track was cut into the precipitous cliff face. His route continues via Sennin-ike, a pond offering views of Mt. Tsurugi, across a glacier, and then along a steep, rocky ridge. Along the way, he comes across tunnels dug in the rock face, and discovers the remains of an old molybdenum mine at an altitude of almost 3,000 meters.\r\n\r\nOn this edition of Journeys in Japan, Cveto leads the way through beautiful autumnal scenery. He explores sites that bear testimony to Japan's modern industrial history. And he overcomes setbacks to finally scale the \"Palace of Crags\" — the summit of Mt. Tsurugi.",

People in Akita love the fish, which was long a traditional source of protein during the winter. They especially enjoy it as the main ingredient in a \"nabemono\" hotpot that is also seasoned with a hatahata by-product, \"shotsuru.\" Shotsuru is unique to Akita and is made from aged, fermented sailfin sandfish. The hotpot dish is called \"shotsuru nabe\" and \"hatahata nabe.\"\r\n\r\nBeing one of Japan's snowiest regions and one of the top production centers of sake, Akita has developed a tradition of enjoying the long winter nights with friends in neighborhood bars and restaurants. Evenings are warmed with the camaraderie, fine sake, and cuisine that is heavy on the blessings of the sea. Fish from the waters off Akita taste the best in winter, because the colder the water is, the richer their flavor...\r\n\r\nOur traveler Charles Glover enjoys to his heart's content the singular culture of the land of snow, Akita, which unfolds in late autumn.",

Even today, Date Masamune remains one of Japan's most popular historical figures.\r\n\r\nOn hunting trips, the warlord would often visit a place called Akiu, where he would relax in the pools of natural hot-spring water.

He is also a university professor who teaches comparative literature and linguistic art and expression.\r\n\r\nIn this edition of Journeys in Japan, Peter arrives in Akiu on the cusp of spring. He discovers the history and natural beauty of the area. He hikes in the hills, meets a local artist and immerses himself in the same hot springs that were such a favorite of Date Masamune.",

        "overview": "Mihonoseki is on the eastern cape of the ShimanePeninsula, surrounded on three sides by water: the Sea of Japan to the north and Miho Bay and Nakaumi to the south. It prospered during the Edo period (1603- 1868), when it was a port of call of Kitamaebune trade ships. Today, it's a fishing port and a gateway to the sea. It still retains charming features from its heyday in the Edo period.\r\nAoishidatami-dori, or the \"blue\" cobblestone alley (named for the color the stones turn in the rain), dates to the era. For visitors to the local beach at sunrise, it might be easy to imagine early Japanese mythology when they see the sky burnish red. The people of Mihonoseki have long cherished their gods and lived with the blessings of the sea. Rituals are an important part of their lives. In April, every year, they hold the Aofushigaki ritual, enacting an episode in mythology when the god Kotoshironushi (more commonly known as Ebisu) decides to hand over his land to the heavenly gods and takes to the sea to hide. Our traveler experiences this ritual, which evokes an archetypical image of Japan's revival. On Journeys in Japan we explore Mihonoseki, where the world of myths live on.",

Of all Japan's 3,000-meter-plus mountains, it is one of the easiest to reach. And its relatively gentle slope makes it a popular destination for alpinists of all levels.\r\n\r\nA ski lift takes you up to the trailhead, and there is a mountain lodge at 2,400 meters which operates during the winter, so it is an ideal climb, even for first-timers. However, the final ascent from the lodge to the peak is a severe climb, just as it is on other 3,000-meter-plus peaks, and should only be attempted by experienced alpinists.\r\n\r\nOn this edition of Journeys in Japan, Liivi Selde discovers the pleasure of snowshoe trekking from Norikura Kogen, at the foot of the mountain. She stays at a secluded hot spring resort, Shirahone Onsen, relaxes in an open-air bath with views of the snow and enjoys the local cuisine.\r\n\r\nThe next day Liivi meets her mountain guide and starts her climb. The lodge where she stays is the only one in the area that is open during the snow season. On the slopes above the lodge, she finds amazing patterns formed in the snow by the powerful winds. After reaching the peak, she is rewarded by a panoramic view stretching to the horizon.",

        "overview": "In recent years, there has been growing interest in backcountry skiing. Many people mistakenly assume that this means just skiing away from the regular slopes and enjoying fresh snow. But backcountry skiing actually requires deep knowledge of winter conditions in the mountains, such as the possibility of avalanches and what action to take when you encounter sudden changes in the weather.\r\nOne popular starting point for backcountry skiing in Japan is the Hakuba area of Nagano Prefecture. There is a well established route connecting the Tsugaike Valley to Mt. Norikuradake, and from there to Renge Onsen and down to the village of Kijiya, in Niigata Prefecture. Of course, there is much more involved than just skiing down the mountainsides. In some places, you have to first make your way to the top of the mountains, using climbing skins on your skis. Although this ascent can be very hard, the reward is the breathtaking experience of gliding down on virgin snow.\r\nIn this edition of Journeys in Japan, Cveto Podlogar explains how to prepare to go out skiing in the backcountry, practicing on the slopes of a ski resort before setting off. As he leads the way on this trip, he demonstrates the deep enjoyment of backcountry skiing.",

But the race held in the town of Obuse, in Nagano Prefecture, is very different.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the Obuse Mini Marathon is not to compete against the clock but for participants to enjoy the hospitality of the local area. There are no major tourist attractions in the town. The runners just move at a relaxed pace through the residential areas and around the surrounding countryside. This event has become famous throughout Japan as the marathon with the largest number of runners in fancy dress.\r\n\r\nIn this edition of Journeys in Japan, Sabrina Sayin comes to Obuse to take part in the Mini Marathon. She also takes time to explore the town, which still retains many buildings from past centuries - including a temple decorated with a work by one of Japan's best known artists, Katsushika Hokusai.",

The primeval woodlands at the base of the mountain range are a habitat of the higuma brown bear. Summer visitors often see the animals frolicking on slopes where there are still snow patches. Taisetsuzan lies at a high latitude, so its alpine zone starts at around 1,700 meters above sea level, 800 meters lower than in the Japanese Alps. Komakusa, Ezo azalea and penstemon grow past that point, as well as spectacular clusters of Aleutian avens. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Peter Skov visits a recently opened flower garden, learns about the brown bears, and sees spectacular fields of alpine flora.",

There are only two traffic lights on the island and no convenience stores or large tourist facilities. The back streets offer a glimpse of old Japan.\r\nOjika once thrived as a fishing base of the East China Sea, when over 10,000 people resided on the island. That was around 60 years ago, though, and with the decline of the fishing industry people moved to the mainland for jobs, leading to a sharp drop in the population.\r\nRecently, however, a change is occurring here. Increasingly people are moving to Ojika. What is it that they have found in Ojika? A charming place of natural beauty, tradition, community spirit and all at an unhurried pace.\r\nIn this edition of Journeys in Japan, American translator B.T. travels to Ojika Island. He discovers the island's appeal through interacting with the locals.",

The 16th-century warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who unified Japan after a long period of civil war, chose it as his power base and built a castle there to serve as the power base for his clan. In the years that followed, Osaka became a major logistical and economic hub. From the mid-19th century, Osaka rode the wave of Japan's modernization and the city expanded rapidly. The development of its spinning industry brought prosperity. During this period it was known as \"Great Osaka\" and saw the construction of many handsome commercial buildings, several of which survive to this day. From the late 1940's, the city was a driving force for Japan's postwar reconstruction and rapid economic growth. In 1970 it became the first city in Asia to host a world's fair, known as Expo '70. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, American architect James Lambiasi visits Osaka and explores its history and culture, as reflected in its impressive architecture.",

The prefectural commitment began during the post-war era in the mid-1900's when the then governor devised an individual policy to rebuild the prefecture's capital city, Takamatsu. Takamatsu City had been reduced to ruins because of repeated air bombings during World War II. The governor launched a huge project of constructing a new building for the prefectural government office that would serve as a symbol of not only post-war reconstruction but also democracy. The spirit of the governor has lived on to date across the prefecture. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, we introduce several architectures that represent Kagawa, and explore the history and culture of the prefecture that has chosen to follow its own path.",

This mountain community is the only place that produces a special variety of tea, called Goishi-cha. The characteristic of this type of tea is its sweet-sour flavor, which is created through the double fermenting of the tea leaves. Goishi-cha is a traditional specialty of Otoyo, which has been passed down in the community for over 400 years. The tradition of making Goishi-cha was on the point of disappearing, but it has been preserved to the present day, thanks to the efforts of one farming family. We visit the farm where it is produced, to find out how it is produced and how the tradition was kept alive. Otoyo also lies on the Yoshino River, which is one of the 3 rivers with the wildest, strongest currents in Japan -- and also the birthplace of rafting in the country. Many visitors come from far and wide in search of whitewater thrills. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, we meet the people of Otoya, who have kept alive their traditions over the centuries, as well as newcomers who have moved into the community, lured by the beauty of its natural environment.",

It grew and prospered thanks to sericulture -- raising the silkworms whose cocoons were the source of raw silk, an essential cornerstone of Japan's efforts to bring in foreign currency and new technology. However, the development of synthetic fibers led to a drop in demand for raw silk, and this led to the decline of Nanmoku as well. Its population has dropped from over 10,000 some 60 years ago to only about 1,700 residents now. But thanks to its remote setting, the village has been spared large-scale development, and its traditional culture and buildings have been preserved much like a time capsule. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Teodora Forgo from Hungary explores the beautiful natural setting and fascinating history of Nanmoku Village, deep in the mountains northwest of Tokyo.",

In its heyday, the mine produced 40 percent of all of Japan's copper and nearly 40,000 people lived in the area. Although mining brought prosperity, it also created massive pollution: Ashio became infamous as the site of the country's first major pollution disaster. Sulfur dioxide gas from the refining process killed off the surrounding forests. And huge amounts of toxic chemicals were carried downstream to the lowlands by the Watarase River. Potter Euan Craig grew up in Bendigo, southeastern Australia, a community that also suffered from the effects of mining pollution. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Euan travels to Ashio to see for himself how people have brought life back to the mountains, thanks to a massive reforestation program. He also visits the Watarase Retarding Basin in the lowlands, and observes how it too has taken on a new life.",

It also became the primary fishing port for the massive herring catch. The fish were used as fertilizer by farms growing cotton. For this reason, demand was strong and herring fetched a high price. Many people made their way to Otaru hoping to prosper from the herring business, and the city's population grew rapidly. In response to this economic boom in Otaru, as many as 25 banks opened branches in the city and it became Hokkaido's financial and trading center. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Isis Berns explores the city of Otaru, delving into its history of fishing and glass-making, to discover the proud vestiges of its past prosperity.",

In recent decades, along with changes in people's lifestyle, the focus of Kasama ware has shifted to tableware and interior goods. Thanks to the town's relaxed atmosphere and openness to outsiders, many potters have moved there from other parts of Japan, producing their own individual works, often using methods they have developed themselves. Euan Craig is a potter from Australia who has lived in Japan for about 30 years. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Euan visits Kasama, to meet the local craftspeople who live and work in this evolving pottery town.",

In the old days, the logs used to be transported by boat down the Asahi River, and the former loading wharf can still be seen. The traditional townscape in Katsuyama has changed little over the past 2 centuries, and many shops line the scenic streets, each with its own traditional Noren shop curtain dyed from hinoki bark.\r\n\r\nThe town has also come up with creative new ways for using its timber.

Because they supply bedding and food, people can traverse the mountains for several days at a time without needing to carry heavy camping equipment with them. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Hayashi Emiri follows one of the finest trails in all Japan — traversing the Jonen Mountain range in Japan's Northern Alps — together with Hirakawa Yoichiro, a mountaineer and guide with extensive experience.

Around the 18th century, more than 100 kinds of confections were created there, elevating the city as one of Japan's most famous centers for wagashi, alongside Kyoto and Kanazawa. To this day, this culture remains an important part of daily life, and for many people it is customary to enjoy these confections as a snack with tea each day in the mid-morning and mid-afternoon. This culture was introduced to Matsue some 300 years ago along with the tea ceremony by the feudal lord of the Matsue domain, Matsudaira Harusato―who is also known as Lord Fumai. Many of the wagashi treats developed in the city during his life are still favorites with the local people. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, American artist Brandon Chin explores the world of wagashi in Matsue, meeting local artisans who are still carrying on the tradition.",
